        When you sign up as a user, mark that you are a trainer, after signing up you go to your profile and see your calendar, 
        if you click somewhere on the calendar a new lesson form will open, 
        there you can fill all the information about the lesson (we recommend to be as much specific as you can) don't worry, you can always edit the information later.
         After you fill the form you will see the new lesson on your calendar, if you'll click on the lesson it will take you to lesson details where you may edit or delete the lesson, see who is registered and chat with trainees.
