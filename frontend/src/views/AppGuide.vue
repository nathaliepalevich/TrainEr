        TrainEr is an app that comes to make sport more accessible for everyone.
        The story began when I turned 33 and I decided to get out from my "couch potato" mood and start doing something useful for my body and soul.
        After countless Google searches,
        schedule cross-checking and frustrating endless phone calls,
        I wondered Working out shouldnâ€™t be hard - what if there was a way to make it easier? I believe that being active is the key to living a happy and healthy life.
