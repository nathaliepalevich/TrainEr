      <h1>About TrainEr</h1>
      <P>
        TrainEr is an app that comes to make sport more accessible for everyone.
        The story began when I turned 33 and I decided to get out from my couch potato mood and start doing something
        usefull for my body and soul.
        After countless Google searches, schedule cross-checking and frustrating endless phone call to all kinds of gym,
        Working out shouldnâ€™t be hard - what if there was a way to make it easy?
        I believe that being active is the key to living a happy and healthy life.
      </P>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <h3>As a trainer</h3>
      <p>
        When you signup as a user, mark that you are a trainer,
        after signing up you go to your profile and see your calendar,
        if you click somewhere on the calendar a new lesson form will open, there you can fill all the information about the lesson (we recomend to be as much specific as you can for the trainers )
        dont worry, you can always edit the information later.
        After you fill the form you will see the new lesson on your calendar, if youll click on the lesson it will take you to lesson details there you could edit the lesson, see who is registered and chat with trainees.
      </p>
      <h3>As a trainee</h3>
